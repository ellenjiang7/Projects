Choosing to design my own project rather than complete a pre-made assignment for my CS15 final project, I put in the extra effort to make Course Schedule Planner a well-designed, user-friendly app. Its purpose is to help students search for courses and plan their semester's course schedule. The user can search for courses by entering a class name, class number, or keyword in the search bar or by clicking on a calendar time slot to search by time. The user can view course descriptions, mouse over course results to see a preview of the course on the calendar, and add and remove courses on the calendar. Course selections are saved automatically. 

See the User's Guide pdf for more detail.
