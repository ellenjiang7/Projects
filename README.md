Course Schedule Planner was my final project for Brown University's CS15 course. Its purpose is to help students search for courses and plan their semester's course schedule. The user can search for courses by entering a class name, class number, or keyword in the search bar or by clicking on a calendar time slot to search by time. The user can view course descriptions, mouse over course results to see a preview of the course on the calendar, and add and remove courses on the calendar. Course selections are saved automatically.

See the User's Guide pdf for more detail.
