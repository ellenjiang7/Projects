Fiction and Ethical Issues in Education,PHIL 2160O,F. Ackerman,M,3:00pm-5:30pm,"This seminar uses fiction as a vehicle for discussing ethical issues in education. It also uses nonfiction by philosophers and other scholars. Topics include the following: What are appropriate aims and appropriate teacher-student relationships for various types and levels of education? How should the academic performance of students and teachers be evaluated? How much, if at all, should schools concern themselves with the non-academic side of students' and teachers' lives? How can fiction enrich the philosophical discussion of such questions? In order to include students with varied backgrounds and interests, this seminar has no prerequisites, despite the high course number."
The Epistemology of Logic,PHIL 2140G,J. Schechter,W,3:00pm-5:30pm,"This seminar focuses on the justification of our logical beliefs and of our employment of deductive rules of inference. What explains our justification? How are we justified in endorsing one logic over alternatives? In this seminar, we will read work by Lewis Carroll, Quine, Carnap, Dummett, Putnam, Boghossian, BonJour, Field, Priest, Haack, Rumfitt, among others. No technical background will be presupposed other than a working knowledge of introductory logic."

Choose Your Own Adventure,LITR 1151F,A. Colarusso,W,3:00pm-5:30pm,"This game is lit. I mean this Lit is a game. How do the design elements of a novel resemble the design elements of a game? And to what extent have interactive [video] games been designed with novelistic conceits? Your adventure begins here, starting with what lies at the dark heart of the literary adventure genre (Defoe, Conrad, Behn). We’ll sojourn at contemporary indie video games (Undertale, Walking Dead, Broken Age, Gone Home), along the way analyzing how “choice” is utilized to build reciprocal fictions. We will also undertake semester-long projects—creating our own 'Choose Your Own Adventure's. WRIT"
