### README ###
In keeping with the department's standard procedure, we are requiring that you put down the logins of any other students that you worked with on the project within the confines of the policy. This is not to trick you, but to help us understand, if code similarity occurred, what may have occurred because of acceptable collaboration--thus, putting down logins of students that you worked with can only help you.

**If you do not put down logins of other students, you are stating that you did not discuss the project with anyone, so any potential collaboration violations found will be evaluated under the original collaboration policy.** In order to utilize the extra mini-assignment level collaboration, you must include the logins of the students that you worked with.

You do not need to put down the logins of students in your design discussion if you only discussed the project with them within the design discussion, though you should include them if you collaborated within the policy beyond that.
